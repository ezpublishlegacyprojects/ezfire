Goto http://www.firephp.org - make sure you have the firephp firefox extension
installed.  Make sure you have the firebug firefox extension installed (because
firephp depends on this.)  Install the FirePHPCore library or use the library
supplied with the extension.

Add ezfire to the extensions directory and add ActiveExtensions[]=ezfire
to your ExtensionSettings
