Maybe add debugbyuser.

The recursive function that builds the arrays for display in the table output option doesn't work correctly.  It does work for objects.

First time through there is the "Can't find useragent string" error...  Any workaround, maybe some javascript history check?  Shouldn't actually affect people.
